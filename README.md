## What I Learned
This was my second version of my personal portfolio. The main motivation for this is that I created my first portfolio when I was fairly new to web developement and only knew HTML, CSS, and SASS. As both my technical and design skills improved overtime I wanted my portfolio to reflect my current knowledge. This version features much more animation and a better UI experience as well as featuring a light and dark theme for easy viewing at anytime.
